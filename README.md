## Approach
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
Gathered Bank Loan Application dataset (‚âà38.6K records).
Key attributes: Loan ID, Purpose, Grade, Sub-grade, Home Ownership, Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Installments, Loan Status, etc.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed duplicates and missing values.
Standardized categorical values (e.g., Purpose, Grade).
Converted date fields (issue year, month) into time-series format.
Created new calculated fields:
Good Loan Flag (Fully Paid + Current)
Bad Loan Flag (Charged-Off)
DTI Ratio Buckets for segmentation.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate analysis: Distribution of loan amounts, terms, interest rates.
Bivariate analysis: Loan Status vs Home Ownership, Employment Length, Loan Purpose.
Trend analysis: Applications over time, state-wise disbursements.
Identified risk patterns among borrower segments.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ KPI Definition
Total Funded Amount
Total Amount Received
Good Loan % vs Bad Loan %
Average Interest Rate
Average DTI

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboarding (Power BI)
Summary Dashboard ‚Üí High-level KPIs (funded, received, interest rate, DTI).
Overview Dashboard ‚Üí Applications by purpose, tenure, home ownership, employee length.
Details Dashboard ‚Üí Loan status, good vs bad loan breakdown, regional trends.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Recommendations
36-month loans perform better than 60-month loans.
Renters & high DTI borrowers ‚Üí higher chance of default.
Debt consolidation loans are the most reliable segment.
Recommendation: tighten approval for high-risk loan purposes (medical, small business, moving).
